The following requirement can be implemented better in the frontEnd of the application. 

When the user/employee address is retrieved, we can use the address/postalCode to get walkScore, TransitScore, 
and crime rate of that neighborhood. 

This can be implemented by using the Geocoding API which converts addresses to GPS coordinates.

The GPS coordinates along with the address then can be used to retrieve the the scores of the neighborhood by
using the walk score api.
